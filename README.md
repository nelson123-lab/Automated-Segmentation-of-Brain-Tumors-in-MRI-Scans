# Automated-Segmentation-of-Brain-Tumors-in-MRI-Scans

- Developed an automated system using 3D image segmentation techniques to accurately identify and isolate brain tumor regions in MRI scans.
- Trained a machine learning model using thresholding, region growing, and machine learning-based methods to segment the tumor regions in the MRI scans.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy in segmenting brain tumors in MRI scans, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning.
- Reduced the workload of radiologists and other medical professionals by automating the segmentation process.
